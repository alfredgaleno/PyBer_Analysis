# PyBer Business Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze business data from the clinet PYber to get a better understanding of how city type affects the amount of drivers, and how much they are paid throughout the year. We grouped our data by 3 types, rural, suburban, and urban. Each environment had different characteristics and pay rates for their drivers.

## Analysis

Upon conducting our analysis we were able to identify specific trends in access and affordability. There are the most drivers in Urban areas and least in rural commmunities. Due to the low supply of drivers in the rural areas the average fares are higher as well as the average far per driver when compared to urband and suburban locations. This relationship is captured in the table below.

As evidenced above the suburban and urban areas have more drivers which in turn lowers the fares and makes the rides more affordable. Throughout the analysis it is clear that there is a fine balance point at which being a Pyber driver is an attractive opportunity, and where there are enough drivers to make rides affordable.

When looking at the ways rides vary over time, it appears there is not a significant change in rides by time period.

The amount made by drivers can vary slightly month to month but on the whole is fairly steady and can be a good source of extra income.


## Results

Upon completion of our analysis it is clear there are a few things that could improve the access and affordability of Pyber. In order to help create a larger pool of drivers in the Rural settings Pyber could create an incentive program to attract more drivers there, they could even pull more drivers from the urban area to increase fares there and lower them in the rural settings. Another option would be to cap the amount of drivers that are allowed to work in the urban areas to keep the fare around $20 per driver. Finally, Pyber could change their matching algorithm to help keep all areas around the same amount of drivers and fares. By doing this drivers would go outside their normal bounds (urban to suburban, suburban to rural) in order to get paid more overall and increase the availability of ride services. Using any of these suggestions should result in better access for the communities and help Pyber get even better.
